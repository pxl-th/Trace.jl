# Bump mapping — perturbs the shading frame from a height texture.
#
# Used for pbrt-v4's `displacement` / `bumpmap` parameter (and indirectly for
# `normalmap`, which is just a different way of saying "use this texture to
# perturb the shading normal"). Without it, Hikari rendered scenes like Crown
# as smooth surfaces; with it, displacement textures on gold and pearl
# materials show through.
#
# This used to be a `BumpMapped{M, T}` WRAPPER material. That wrapper doubled
# the concrete material type count of any scene that bump-maps some of its
# surfaces — `Conductor{…}` and `BumpMapped{Conductor{…}, TextureRef{…}}` are
# different types, so the per-material closest-hit path compiled a separate
# shader for each. pbrt-v4 does not wrap: `displacement` is a plain field on
# every `Material`, and `Material::GetBxDF` is oblivious to it. Hikari now does
# the same — `displacement(mat)` is a `TexHandle` field, NONE when absent, and
# the perturbation is one predictable branch per hit.
#
# Algorithm follows pbrt-v4 §9.3 "Bump Mapping":
#   1. Sample the height texture h at (u, v), (u+ε, v), (u, v+ε).
#   2. Compute ∂h/∂u, ∂h/∂v by finite differences.
#   3. Perturb the tangent vectors:
#        dpdu' = dpdu + (∂h/∂u) * ns
#        dpdv' = dpdv + (∂h/∂v) * ns
#   4. New shading normal n' = normalize(dpdu' × dpdv'); preserve sign.
#   5. Re-orthonormalize dpdu' against n'.
#
# `dpdvs` is reconstructed at evaluation time as cross(ns, dpdus), mirroring
# how `vp_compute_shading_tangents` builds it in volpath/intersection.jl.
# ============================================================================

# Floor on the finite-difference step when the texture-filter screen-space
# derivatives are zero (e.g. when the integrator does not propagate ray
# differentials). Matches pbrt-v4 materials.h::BumpMap: `if (du == 0) du = .0005f`.
# This is sub-texel on Crown's 1024×1024 bump maps; the earlier 1/256 default
# was 4× the texel size and averaged out the high-frequency ornamental
# engraving on the gold dome (mitra_right_back conductor + bump).

raw geometric ∂p/∂u; the tilt of n_p depends on the ratio |dhdu|/|dpdu|.
Passing the unit-length shading tangent over-tilted n_p by 2-60× — that
was the bumped-gold leak into the crown interior pinned by
`shadow_bumpgold_dome_over_velvet`.
