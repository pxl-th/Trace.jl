# MixMaterial - Stochastically blends between two materials
# ============================================================================
# Port of pbrt-v4's MixMaterial using stochastic material selection
#
# The material uses a mixing amount texture to blend between two materials:
# - amount = 0: always select material 1
# - amount = 1: always select material 2
# - 0 < amount < 1: stochastically select based on deterministic hash
#
# Reference: pbrt-v4 src/pbrt/materials.h MixMaterial
#
# IMPORTANT: MixMaterial is resolved at intersection time, not at BSDF evaluation.
# This means the integrator's intersection kernel must call choose_material()
# before creating material evaluation work items.

    MixMaterial

A material that stochastically blends between two sub-materials based on a mixing amount.

Following pbrt-v4, the material selection is deterministic based on:
- The intersection position and viewing direction
- A hash function to generate deterministic randomness
- The `amount` texture value at the hit point

# Fields
- `amount`: blend ratio (0 = material1, 1 = material2)
- `material1_idx`: scene-materials key of the first sub-material
- `material2_idx`: scene-materials key of the second sub-material

# Usage
MixMaterial is resolved at intersection time before material evaluation.
The integrator should call `choose_material()` to get the actual material index
to use for the hit point, then proceed with normal material evaluation.
"""
# NON-PARAMETRIC, and that matters more here than anywhere else: the
# MixMaterial closest-hit shader has to dispatch over EVERY material type in
# the scene (see rt-pipeline.jl `T <: MixMaterial`), so it inlines the whole
# shading system. One MixMaterial type per distinct sub-material PAIR therefore
# cost a full copy of that shader each — the two Crown mixes were the single
# largest item in its compile time.
#
# pbrt-v4 has the same shape: `MixMaterial` holds `Material materials[2]`,
# where `Material` is a TaggedPointer into a heterogeneous pool. `SetKey` is
# our TaggedPointer, so the sub-materials are referenced, not embedded. The
# consequence is that a MixMaterial can only be built against a scene, since
# that is what hands out the keys.

"""
    MixMaterialSpec(material1, material2, amount)

Host-side form of a [`MixMaterial`](@ref), holding the two sub-materials
themselves rather than their keys. A `Scene` hands out keys only at push time,
and materials are routinely built before any scene exists (RayMakie constructs
them inside a plot's argument-conversion node), so the mix carries its
sub-materials until then. `resolve_material` turns it into the device form.
