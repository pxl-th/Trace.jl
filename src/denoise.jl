    DenoiseConfig

Configuration parameters for the à-trous wavelet denoiser.

# Fields
- `iterations`: Number of filter passes (each doubles the filter radius)
- `sigma_color`: Color edge-stopping threshold (luminance sensitivity)
- `sigma_normal`: Normal edge-stopping threshold (angular sensitivity)
- `sigma_depth`: Depth edge-stopping threshold (distance sensitivity)

"""
    DenoiseConfig(; iterations=4, sigma_color=1.0, sigma_normal=64.0,
                    sigma_depth=0.1)

Create a denoiser configuration with sensible defaults.

Units (post log-luminance / relative-depth fix):
- `sigma_color` is in **stops** (log2 luminance diff) — 1.0 means a 2× ratio
  weighted at `exp(-1) ≈ 0.37`. Lower = sharper edges.
- `sigma_normal` is the exponent on `clamp(dot(n_p, n_q), 0, 1)`. Higher =
  more sensitive to normal differences.
- `sigma_depth` is **relative** depth tolerance (fraction of local depth) —
  0.1 means a 10% depth diff per filter step weighted at `exp(-1)`.

There is no `use_variance`: real SVGF needs *temporal* variance from sample
history, which a `Film` does not store, and the spatial substitute was actively
harmful — it mistakes texture for noise. See `weight_color`. It used to be a
field that did nothing, plus a kernel argument that had to be a zero-length
device array to keep the signature; that array was freed under the running
dispatch, so the GPU denoiser could not run at all.

"""
    weight_color(lum_p, lum_q, sigma) -> Float32

Color/luminance edge-stopping weight in **log-luminance space** (HDR-safe).
`sigma` is in *stops* (log2 luminance ratio) — a 2^sigma ratio between p and q
weights to `exp(-1) ≈ 0.37`.

**Asymmetric:** when `q` is dimmer than the center `p` we treat the diff as
`FIREFLY_RATIO ≈ 0.3×` of its actual magnitude, so bright outliers pool down
into their dim surroundings (firefly suppression). When `q` is brighter we
stay strict so genuine edges viewed from the dim side are preserved. This is
the standard fix for à-trous's intrinsic inability to remove fireflies via a
purely symmetric bilateral weight — a firefly otherwise looks like an edge.

There is deliberately no variance term: real SVGF needs *temporal* variance from
sample history, which this `Film` does not store, and the spatial substitute was
actively harmful — it mistakes texture for noise.

"""
    weight_depth(d_p, d_q, sigma, step_size) -> Float32

Depth edge-stopping weight using a **relative** depth difference so the same
`sigma` works at any scene scale. `sigma` is the fractional depth tolerance
(e.g. `0.1` = 10% of local depth). Scales with `step_size` because the
expected per-step depth delta on an angled surface grows with filter radius.

Standard SVGF/EAW would use the actual screen-space depth gradient `∇d`
here; we approximate it by `max(d_p, d_q) * step_size`, which is correct up
to a constant for perspective surfaces and never blows up for misses.

Keyed on the film's framebuffer and the iteration count, because both are baked
