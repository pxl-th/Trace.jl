# Where a render state's device memory comes from, and the only thing that gives
# it back.
#
# It used to come from `KA.allocate` and go back through `finalize`, scattered
# across the state, the work queues, the light BVH upload and the Sobol matrices
# — twelve `finalize` calls that a reader had to find and keep in step. That is
# the pattern the project rule forbids in as many words: memory management is
# centralized, and high-level code never finalizes GPU resources. The comments
# around those calls record what it cost — "a bare reassign races GC finalizers
# and doubles peak memory", "proactive free! from a finalizer would free arrays
# still in use by the render loop" — which is a lifetime protocol maintained by
# hand and commented rather than expressed.
#
# Here every allocation is a `Mantle.Buffer` from the device's pool, and the
# whole tree goes back in one call. Three things follow that are not just
# tidiness:
#
#   * one allocator sees the renderer's memory. `Mantle.peakbytes` and the pool's
#     own accounting now cover ~1.9 GiB of work queues that were invisible to it.
#   * nothing in this package finalizes a GPU resource. A missed release is a
#     leak the pool can report, not a use-after-free.
#   * the release order stops mattering. `free!` walks one list.
#
# What the buffers hold is unchanged: `Mantle.storage` hands back a `LavaArray`
# view that owns nothing, so the queues and accumulators are the same arrays the
# kernels always saw, and `Adapt`, `use!` and every `@kernel` are untouched.

    DeviceMemory(backend)

Constructed from a KernelAbstractions backend because that is what a renderer
has; it resolves the Mantle device once and allocates from that device's pool
thereafter. One per state, and it dies with the state.

none of the `KA.synchronize` calls that used to guard these — one before every
plan rebuild, every queue rebuild and every teardown, each of them a place to
