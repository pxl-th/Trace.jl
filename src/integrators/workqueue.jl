# Trait: should this type be decomposed into SOA?

# Nested types (Ray, Vec3f, Spectrum, etc.) stay flat since they're small

# ============================================================================

"""
    WorkQueue{T, V, S}

A GPU-compatible work queue that stores items of type T.
Uses atomic operations for thread-safe push operations.

The queue stores items in a pre-allocated buffer and uses an atomic
counter to track the current size. Supports both AOS and SOA layouts.

# Fields
- `items::V`: Pre-allocated array of work items
- `size::S`: Single-element array for atomic counter
- `capacity::Int32`: Maximum number of items

# Example
```julia
# Create a queue in the memory a render state owns
queue = WorkQueue{MyWorkItem}(mem, 1024)

# In a kernel, push items atomically
idx = push!(queue, item)

# Check if push succeeded (within capacity)
if idx <= length(queue.items)
    # item was stored at queue.items[idx]
end
```

# A queue has no `free!` of its own: its arrays are views into regions the
# state's `DeviceMemory` owns, so `free!(mem)` releases them and there is nothing
# per-queue to remember. What used to be here walked the SOA components calling
# `finalize` on each, because `finalize(::StructArray)` is a no-op and would have
# left them alive until the GC ran — one more piece of a lifetime protocol that
# is now the pool's.

"""
    WorkQueue{T}(mem::DeviceMemory, capacity; soa=should_use_soa(T))

Create a new work queue with the given capacity, in memory the render state
owns.

# Arguments
- `mem`: the state's [`DeviceMemory`](@ref); `free!(mem)` releases this queue
- `capacity`: Maximum number of items the queue can hold
- `soa`: If true, use Structure-of-Arrays layout for better GPU memory coalescing.
  Defaults to `should_use_soa(T)` so flagged item types automatically get the
  faster layout without every caller having to remember the kwarg. (Before
  this default was wired up, the trait was set on `VPRayWorkItem` and friends
  but never actually read — every queue was AOS regardless.)

# — one dispatch per type, all in one graph pass, since they are independent.

# switch inside the kernel), so the resulting SPIR-V is small and the warps
# never diverge on material-type branches.
