    approximate_dp_dxy(pi, n, camera, samples_per_pixel) -> (dpdx, dpdy)

Approximate screen-space position derivatives at intersection point.
Following pbrt-v4's Camera::Approximate_dp_dxy method.

This estimates how much the surface position changes per pixel, which is used
for texture filtering (mipmap level selection). The approximation assumes the
surface is locally planar near the intersection point.

For a perspective camera, this is approximately:
    dp/dscreen ≈ distance * tan(fov/2) / (resolution/2)

Arguments:
- `pi`: Intersection point in world space
- `n`: Surface normal at intersection
- `camera`: Camera with dx_camera, dy_camera precomputed
- `samples_per_pixel`: Number of samples per pixel (for scaling)

Returns (dpdx, dpdy) - approximate change in position per screen pixel.

    surface_dp_dxy(camera, ray_o, ray_d, p, n, samples_per_pixel, depth) -> (dpdx, dpdy)

Screen-space position derivatives at a hit point.

pbrt-v4 `SurfaceInteraction::ComputeDifferentials` (interaction.cpp:48) uses the
ray's TRUE differentials whenever it has them, and only falls back to
`Camera::Approximate_dp_dxy` when it does not. Camera rays always have them
(`GenerateRayDifferential`); indirect bounces never do, because the path
integrators do not propagate differentials. So `depth == 0` gets the exact
footprint and everything deeper gets the approximation — matching pbrt on both
branches rather than approximating everywhere.

This matters well beyond mipmap selection: the footprint sets
`δu = 0.5(|dudx|+|dudy|)`, the finite-difference step `perturb_bump_frame` uses
for `∂h/∂u`. A wrong footprint tilts the bumped normal, which MOVES specular
highlights rather than just dimming them. Measured on crown.pbrt as a coherent
dipole on the displaced dome panels.

Only `PerspectiveCamera` implements the exact form — it is the camera the pbrt
importer builds, and the reconstruction below depends on its near-plane
convention. Other cameras keep the approximation.

# ============================================================================
#
# One kernel per concrete material type, monomorphised via `ForEachType`, so
# a kernel's SPIR-V contains exactly one material's BSDF. The alternative — a
# single kernel with every material's BSDF behind a `with_index` switch —
# measured 128 registers on RTX 4000 Ada, right at the occupancy cliff (above
# 128 the per-SM thread count drops from 512 to 256).
#
# This is the ONLY surface-shading implementation, and the closest-hit shaders
# call the same two inner functions. A second, `with_index`-based copy used to
# live here and was dispatched for exactly one configuration (hardware RT on a
# scene with media), which is how it drifted: Phase 1 moved every BSDF onto a
# `get_bxdf` carrier, this copy was updated, the other kept calling the raw
# material and silently matched a gray-Lambertian `::Material` catch-all — a
# specular medium boundary became a diffuse wall and `medium_smoke_point`
# rendered at 0.037 of reference on HW while SW was correct. Everything that
# copy did beyond shading — MixMaterial resolution, the null-material medium
# swap — already happens at the push site for both producers
# (`vp_trace_and_shade_kernel!` and delta tracking's `vp_sample_medium_kernel!`),
# so it was redundant as well as divergent.
#
# Pieces:
#   * `surface_direct_lighting_inner!` / `evaluate_material_inner!` — take the
#     BxDF carrier `get_bxdf` built for this hit and call
#     `evaluate_bsdf_spectral` / `sample_bsdf_spectral` on it directly. Sobol
#     inlined, shadow trace inlined.
#   * `vp_shade_material_kernel!` — reads `TypedHitRef{T}`, loads the hit from
#     the shared `hit_surface_queue`, looks up the
#     concrete instance via `material_of_type(materials, T, vec_idx)` (one
#     array load resolved at compile time), accumulates emission, runs DL
#     + indirect path.
#   * the "shade" pass (graph.jl) — one dispatch per queue of the
#     `MultiTypeMaterialQueue`, all in ONE pass, because they are independent:
#     each per-type kernel writes disjoint slots of the shared `next_ray_queue`
#     and atomic `pixel_L`. A pass is the unit barriers go between, so they
#     overlap on idle SMs rather than serialising.
