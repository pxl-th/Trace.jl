# SOA Override for VolPath Work Items
# ============================================================================

# Override should_use_soa for VolPath work items that benefit from SOA layout.
#
# pbrt-v4's wavefront integrator declares its work items in a .soa DSL
# (wavefront/workitems.soa) that the build system expands into per-field
# SOA<T> templates. The reason: every queue is large enough (≥ scene-pixel-
# count entries) and each shading kernel reads many fields out of each work
# item across many threads — the AOS stride wastes most of the memory
# bandwidth on cache lines whose other fields the warp doesn't need this
# pass. SOA fixes this by giving each field its own coalesced array.
#
# The big items (≥ 64 B) are the ones where the bandwidth difference shows
# up at render scale. The defaults below cover every queue that's heavy
# enough to matter: the two ray queues, surface-hit, material-eval, shadow,
# escaped, and the two medium queues. Trait dispatch is read by
# `WorkQueue{T}(backend, capacity)` which defaults `soa=should_use_soa(T)` —
# so flagging a new work-item type here is sufficient to opt it in.
should_use_soa(::Type{VPRayWorkItem}) = true

should_use_soa(::Type{VPMaterialEvalWorkItem}) = true
should_use_soa(::Type{VPMediumSampleWorkItem}) = true

# VPRaySamples used to be a per-pixel Sobol cache filled by
# vp_generate_ray_samples_kernel!; that kernel and its buffer are gone now
# (samples are computed inline in each consumer), so the SOA hint is no
# longer needed.
