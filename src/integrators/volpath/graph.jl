# One volpath sample, as Mantle graphs.
#
# The wavefront loop is ~20 dispatches a round whose only ordering constraints
# are which queue each stage fills and which one it drains. Those constraints
# used to be expressed by the order of the calls plus two hand-placed
# `concurrent_dispatch_group` / `concurrent_indirect_group` scopes asserting
# which dispatches were independent — an assertion nothing checked, and the one
# that was wrong (a prepare-indirect read racing its own producer) cost ~15 % of
# the energy on a scene where the queue happened to empty mid-pipeline.
#
# Here each stage declares what it reads and what it writes, and the barriers
# between them are derived from that. A stage that shares nothing with its
# neighbour gets no barrier and the two overlap; a stage that drains what
# another filled waits for exactly those bytes.
#
# Three graphs, because two of the boundaries are the host's:
#
#   setup       clear the film, reset the ray queue, generate camera rays
#   round       one bounce, built twice for the two directions of the ray
#               queue ping-pong
#   accumulate  this sample's spectral radiance into the RGB accumulators
#
# and `finalize` for the divide, which is its own plan because a batched caller
# runs it once after every sample rather than per sample.
#
# The bounce loop stays a host loop: a `Plan` is compiled once and run many
# times, so a plan per round expresses it, and the early exit reads a device
# counter and breaks — which no graph-level loop node would make cheaper.

# What is NOT here: the queues are Hikari's own allocations, read by the passes
# as foreign buffers. A graph can order accesses to a buffer it does not own; it
# cannot adopt one into its arena, and aliasing is the arena's. Moving them was
# the obvious last step of the port and it is measured to be worth nothing on
# this loop — `benchmarks/queue_aliasing/aliasing.jl` puts every intermediate
# queue in the placer's hands at 1280x1080 and gets 174 MiB back for ONE round
# and exactly zero for two or more, because every queue is refilled every round
# and so is live from the first to the last. The shipped chunk is eight.

Six stages of a round do exactly one thing to the per-pixel radiance —
`atomic +=` — and the order they do it in does not change the sum. Declared as
an ordinary read-write that is a hazard between every pair of them, so the
escaped, emitter and shading stages are ordered against each other even though
their queues are disjoint and nothing else connects them. `Unordered` is the
vocabulary for exactly this, and it is checked on both sides: only two stages
that BOTH declare it may overlap, so the film clear before them and the
accumulate after them still get their barriers.

Float addition is not associative, so the sum's last bits depend on the order
the additions land in — which is already true between invocations of one
dispatch and is why the pbrt gate is a tolerance and not an equality.

    render_refs(...) -> NamedTuple

What a sample is rendered with. Two kinds of value:

- **Per-run values are `Mantle.GPURef`s** — `camera`, `initial_medium`,
  `filter_params`, `sample_idx`. Device storage at an address that does not
  move: every dispatch that reads one is packed with that address, once, and
  a new value is stored through the ref (`ref[] = x`) and lands in the run's
  own submission. So one recording renders every sample, and a moved camera
  is one command, not a new plan. `sample_idx` is not even that: the sample
  plan's first pass increments it on the device, and the host stores to it
  only to start the count over (see [`resetsamples!`](@ref)).
- **Everything else is baked** — resolved when the plans record and fixed for
  as long as they live. A change to any of them is a scene or integrator edit,
  and those invalidate the plans where they happen (`sync!(scene)`, the scene
  mutators, [`invalidate!`](@ref)) — nothing is compared per sample.

They were ALL `Ref`s, and a `Ref` meant "re-read me every run": Mantle rewrote
the argument bytes of every dispatch holding one, per run, on the host. Measured
on the fused sample that is 602 writes to move 268 bytes — and because those
bytes could be in flight, the plan needed three copies of its arguments and a
wait to rotate between them.

much the host has to say per sample. A plan is recorded when it runs, so a plan
per round means `max_depth` recordings, `max_depth` submissions and `max_depth`
walks over the pass list; `n` rounds in one plan means one of each per `n`.

What makes it expressible at all is that nothing in a round is decided on the
host. Every stage sizes itself off a device-resident count, so a recording is
valid whatever the ray population turns out to be — including zero, where every
dispatch is a no-op and the round costs its commands and nothing else.

The queues alternate inside the graph rather than between plans, which is why
there is one of these and not two: the ping-pong is now an implementation detail
of the recording. `n` rounds starting at A end at A when `n` is even, which is
what lets the same plan run back to back.

    sample_graph(dev, state, refs, max_depth; …) -> Graph

A whole sample as one graph: setup, the bounce loop, accumulate.

The loop is a `Mantle.repeat!` gated on the ray queue's own live count. That is
the whole reason this can be one graph — the host neither reads that count nor
decides how many rounds run, so there is nothing to break the recording up for.

**The body is TWO rounds, and two is the minimum rather than a tuning knob.** A
round reads one ray queue and writes the other, so an odd body would leave the
queues swapped and the next iteration would read the wrong one; two returns them
to where it found them, which is what makes one recording valid for every
iteration. It also fixes the overshoot: the loop can only stop on an even
boundary, so at most one dead round runs after the rays are gone.

This replaces a host loop that drained the pipeline every eight rounds to read
the same counter. Eight was that drain's amortisation constant — `live_rounds/8`
stalls per sample, bought with up to seven dead rounds of overshoot — and with
the test on the device there is nothing left to amortise.

`finalize` is not here. It is one dispatch, and `render!` takes a kwarg to skip
it between samples: a per-call decision, which is the one thing a single
recording cannot express.

The compiled plans for one scene shape, film and integrator configuration.

Two plans, because a sample is two things: everything that produces the picture,
and the divide that writes it out. `sample` holds setup, the whole bounce loop
and accumulate; it used to be four plans driven by a host `while` loop, which
existed only so the host could read the ray count between chunks.

There is no key and no per-sample comparison: `refs` holds the values the plans
were packed with, the per-run ones as `GPURef`s a store lands in the run's own
submission — and `stored` what was last stored to them, which is the one thing
a sample compares against (see [`storechanged!`](@ref)). The plans live until the scene or the integrator is edited —
which is where they are dropped (`sync!(scene)`, the scene mutators,
[`invalidate!`](@ref)) — or the film's framebuffer is replaced, which is the one
identity a `render!` still checks, because the film is a per-call argument and
no verb announces its swap.

# its argument: 1015 bytes a sample, on a `run!` that costs 338 by itself.
