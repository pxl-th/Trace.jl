"""
    MatrixCamera <: Camera

A camera defined by view and projection matrices, matching the convention used by
Makie's `Camera` struct (OpenGL-style: camera looks along -z in camera space).

This is a fallback camera for scenes that don't use `Camera3D` (e.g. `Axis3` which
uses its own camera type but still sets view/projection matrices on the scene camera).

The view matrix is world-to-camera, and the projection matrix is camera-to-clip (NDC).
Both use OpenGL conventions (right-handed, camera looks along -z, clip z in [-1, 1]).
