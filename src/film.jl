`film`'s layers on `backend`, in memory this film owns.

Replaces `Adapt.adapt(backend, film)`, which was doing the allocating — `adapt`
converts, and a conversion that reaches for an allocator has nowhere to put one,
which is why the result could only ever be freed by the GC. `free!(film)`
releases these; forgetting it retires them instead of losing them.

`filter_table` stays on the host: it is read when the plans are built, never by a
kernel. `iteration_index` is shared with `film`, as it was before — it is the
progressive sample counter, and two films disagreeing about it is the bug.
