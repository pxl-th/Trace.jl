"""
Compute radiance arriving at `ref.p` interaction point at `ref.time` time
due to the ambient light.

# Args

- `a::AmbientLight`: Ambient light which illuminates the interaction point `ref`.
- `ref::Interaction`: Interaction point for which to compute radiance.
- `u::Point2f`: Sampling point that is ignored for `AmbientLight`,
    since it emits light uniformly.

# Returns

`Tuple{S, Vec3f, Float32, VisibilityTester} where S <: Spectrum`:

    - `S`: Computed radiance.
    - `Vec3f`: Incident direction to the light source `wi`.
    - `Float32`: Probability density for the light sample that was taken.
        For `AmbientLight` it is always `1`.
    - `VisibilityTester`: Initialized visibility tester that holds the
        shadow ray that must be traced to verify that
        there are no occluding objects between the light and reference point.
