# Plans are invalidated where the change HAPPENS — nothing is compared per
# sample.
#
# - A moved camera is a `GPURef` update: the same plans object answers, and the
#   picture moves.
# - A scene edit drops the plans of every listening integrator, at the verb:
#   `push!` and a `sync!` that rebuilt. The next `render!` builds new ones.
# - `Hikari.invalidate!` is the verb for the integrator's own fields.
#
# Each is pinned from the outside: the identity of `vp.state.plans`, and the
# render still being right afterwards.
