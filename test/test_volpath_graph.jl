# The volpath sample as Mantle plans.
#
# What these pin is the part of the port a rendered image would not obviously
# catch: that the plans are REUSED across samples rather than rebuilt, and that
# reusing them still advances everything a sample is supposed to advance. A
# compiled dispatch resolves its arguments once, so a sample index left behind
# in the plan it was built with would render the same sample N times — and the
# picture would look plausible, just converged to the wrong thing.
