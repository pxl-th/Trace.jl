# The blackbody -> RGB emitter conversion normalizes LUMINANCE to 1, and that is
# deliberate. It looks wrong next to pbrt-v4, which normalizes its Planck
# spectrum so the PEAK value is 1 (`BlackbodySpectrum`: 1/Blackbody(λ_max, T),
# λ_max from Wien). Those differ by a lot — the peak-normalized spectrum has
# luminance 0.9796 at 5500 K and 0.2763 at 2700 K — so "make it match pbrt" is a
# tempting and plausible-looking change.
#
# It is a REGRESSION. pbrt is a spectral renderer: it never builds an emitter
# RGB, it samples wavelengths and resolves them in `PixelSensor`, which applies
# its own imaging ratio and white balance. Hikari's RGB pipeline consumes a
# luminance-normalized emitter instead. Measured on the two blackbody suite
# scenes (5500 K, `scale 10`), same harness, same pbrt reference:
