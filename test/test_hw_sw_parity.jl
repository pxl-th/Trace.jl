# HW vs SW rendering parity: a simple scene rendered with the hardware
# ray-tracing path (VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline via Lava's RT pipeline) and
# with the software BVH path (Raycore BVH + compute shaders) must produce
# the same pixels within a small tolerance.  Both paths should hit the
# same material eval, the same light sampling, the same integrator loop —
# only the ray-triangle intersection differs.
#
# This catches regressions in either path: a BVH-builder bug changes SW
# only; a LavaTLAS instance-override bug changes HW only; a material eval
# regression shows up in both (test still passes) but the test harness
# elsewhere would catch it.

    #     tesselated geometry.
