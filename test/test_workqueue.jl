# `WorkQueue`'s own behaviour: construction, the atomic push, empty!, and what
# happens past capacity.
#
# This coverage existed as `test/workqueue.jl`, which `runtests.jl` never
# referenced in the entire history of the repo — so none of it had ever run. It
# was written against `WorkQueue{T}(backend, capacity)` and a `cleanup!` that no
# longer exist. Ported to the current API (a queue takes a `DeviceMemory`, and
# the pool reclaims it) and actually wired in.
#
# Everything here goes through a KERNEL, because that is the only way anything
# calls `push!`: every call site in `src/integrators/volpath/` is inside a
# `@kernel` body, and there is no host-side caller. Pushing from the host is a
# different lowering — Atomix's pointer atomic over a plain `Vector` instead of
# a device atomic over a `LavaDeviceArray` reached through `Adapt` — so a
# host-backend test would exercise a path production never takes while looking
# like it covered the queue. The original file's CPU section did exactly that,
# which is the likeliest reason it was never wired in.
