#
# pbrt reference suite — shared helpers
#
# Single source of truth for:
#   * locating scenes + references
#   * rendering a scene with Hikari (VolPath), parametrized by backend / spp /
#     max_depth / hw_accel
#   * loading a pre-committed pbrt-v4 EXR reference (optionally generating it
#     if the pbrt binary is available)
#   * image comparison metrics (log-space tile p95, energy ratio, mean/median
#     per-pixel diff)
#
# This file defines functions only — it does not run tests. It is `include`d
# by test_pbrt_all_materials.jl (normal @testset runner) and by
# run_comparison.jl (gallery-generating script). Both drive the same
# render/compare code so they can't drift.
