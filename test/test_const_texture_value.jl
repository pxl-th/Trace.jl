# A 0-d `Texture` carries its value in one of two places depending on which
# constructor built it:
#
#   Texture(arr)      -> value in `data`,     `constval` zeroed, isconst=false
#   ConstTexture(val) -> value in `constval`, `data` is Array{T,0}(undef)
#
# Every conversion to a `TexHandle` used to read `data[]` unconditionally, so a
# `ConstTexture` produced a handle holding *uninitialised memory*. Nothing in
# the pbrt builder hit it (scalar parameters arrive as raw `Real`/`RGBSpectrum`
# and take the value overloads), but RayMakie's `merge_color_with_material`
# passes the plot's colour through as a const 0-d `Texture` — so a coloured
# Makie plot got a material whose Kd was garbage. Garbage that happened to be
# negative renders black, which is how it surfaced: geometry in the TLAS,
# nothing in the image.
#
# The value is compared against `constval` rather than any particular number:
# the point is which FIELD is read, not what is in it.
