# CheckerboardTexture is an exact port of pbrt-v4's CheckerboardTexture
# (textures.cpp `Checkerboard()`, 2D case, fused with UVMapping::Map). It
# replaced the 256² LUT rasterization in the pbrt scene builder: the LUT's
# bilinear smoothing both quantized checker-edge positions and widened the
# height-gradient bands that bump mapping differentiates, which biased
# shadow_bumpgold_dome_over_velvet 21% dark at 256 spp.
#
# These tests pin the analytic evaluation against hand-computed pbrt values so
# the LUT (or any other approximation) can't sneak back in.

# Reference implementation of pbrt-v4's helpers, straight from textures.cpp.

# ── the analytic filter's own bound ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `checker_bf` is a triangle-filtered ±1 square wave, so |bf| <= 1 by
# construction. The expression that computes it is a second difference divided
# by `r * r`, and near a cell boundary with a small radius the numerator is all
# cancellation — at `x = 1.0f0, r = 1f-6` it evaluated to 59604.6 before the
# clamp, a factor of sixty thousand over its own bound.
#
# That is not a cosmetic overshoot. The caller mixes with it as
# `(1 - w) * tex1 + w * tex2`, so a huge `w` extrapolates far outside the two
# texture values: for the `tex_conductor_checker_rough_light_point` scene's
# 0.01/0.3 roughness pair it produced roughness = -5.15e8, and
# `roughness_to_α` is `sqrt`. C++ answers `std::sqrt(-x)` with a NaN and loses
# one pixel; Julia THROWS, and the whole GPU dispatch dies with
# `DomainError: This operation requires a complex input to return a complex
# result`. Both that scene and its dielectric twin failed that way on the
# software and hardware paths alike.
