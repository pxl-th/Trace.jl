"""
A sample is one `run!`, and for a still scene it is nothing else.

Every per-sample value reaches the recorded plans through a `GPURef`, stored
only when it changed (`storechanged!`); the sample index is not even that — the
sample plan's first pass increments it on the device, and the host stores to it
only to start the count over (`resetsamples!`). So after the first sample of a
still scene nothing is dirty, a `render!` leaves nothing dirty, and a moved
camera stores the camera and nothing else. `test_plan_invalidation.jl` pins that
the same plans object answers a moved camera; this pins WHAT the host did for
it.

The last testset — one submission and no allocation per sample — went RED
until the open command buffer went (step 7 of Mantle's
`docs/submission-refactor.md`): a run used to be appended to a batch that
allocated a segment for it and submitted when something else asked. Step 7
closed it: a run is one submission, made at once, and the recorded plan
allocates nothing on the way.
