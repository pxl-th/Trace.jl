# Regression: `sample_texture_data` used to clamp UVs outside [0,1] to the edge
# pixel. pbrt-v4's ImageTexture defaults to "repeat" wrap mode, and scenes like
# killeroo-gold.pbrt rely on tiling a `lines.png` grid across UV [0,5]. The
# clamp caused only one tile (the first cell) to show, with everything past
# the edge reading the nearest border pixel.
