# Screen-space differentials at a hit point.
#
# pbrt-v4 `SurfaceInteraction::ComputeDifferentials` uses the ray's TRUE
# differentials on camera rays and only approximates deeper. Hikari approximated
# EVERYWHERE, which matters far beyond mipmap selection: the footprint sets
# `δu = 0.5(|dudx|+|dudy|)`, the finite-difference step `perturb_bump_frame` uses
# for `∂h/∂u`. A wrong footprint tilts the bumped normal, which MOVES specular
# highlights instead of merely dimming them. On crown.pbrt that showed up as a
# coherent dipole over the displaced dome panels;
# `shadow_bumpgold_dome_over_velvet` scored tile 0.0699 against a 0.07 gate and
# dropped to 0.0499 once this was right.
#
# The ground truth here is not another formula — it is literally generating the
# neighbouring pixel's ray and differencing where the two land. That is what a
# differential IS, so this test cannot drift from the definition.
#
# It also pins the constant that made the first attempt WRONG: `dx_camera` and
# `dy_camera` are offsets on the plane `raster_to_camera` maps the film onto, and
# that plane is at 2x the camera's `near`, not `near` itself. Reconstructing a
# camera-space point on the wrong plane made every differential exactly 2x too
# large, which rendered visibly worse (tile 0.0699 -> 0.193).
