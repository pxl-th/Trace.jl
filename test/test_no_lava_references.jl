What Hikari still names from Lava, and why each one is allowed to stay.

This file used to be a debt ledger. `Lava.` in Hikari's source meant a renderer
reaching into a Vulkan runtime, and the list existed to stop it growing while the
runtime was moved out. On 2026-08-27 it was: **22 names across 3 files.**

The move happened. Lava is a Julia→SPIR-V compiler with no Vulkan dependency, and
everything Hikari used to reach for — `LavaBackend`, `VulkanTLAS`, `vk_context`,
`RayTracingPipeline`, `@compile_workload` — is Mantle's. What is left is 13
names in ONE file, and they are a different kind of thing entirely:

    lava_rt_launch_id_x   lava_rt_trace_ray        lava_rt_primitive_id
    lava_rt_ray_tmax      lava_rt_instance_id      lava_rt_instance_custom_index
    lava_rt_hit_bary_u    lava_rt_hit_bary_v       lava_rt_reorder_thread
    lava_rt_hit_object_trace_ray   lava_rt_hit_object_execute_shader
    lava_rt_payload_store_f32_at   lava_rt_payload_load_f32_at

Those were **device-side ray-tracing intrinsics** — what a shader BODY calls,
lowered by the compiler to `OpTraceRayKHR` and friends — and the docstring said
they would leave "if KI ever grows a ray-tracing half".

It did. Phase 2.1 made the shader vocabulary `KernelInterface`'s and Mantle
re-exports it, so `rt-pipeline.jl` names `rt_launch_id_x` from Mantle where it
named `lava_rt_launch_id_x` from Lava, and the count is now **zero names in zero
files**. The ledger is closed: this file asserts that Hikari names NOTHING from
Lava, and any reference at all is the split coming undone.

`src/precompile_statements.jl` is skipped: generated from a compile trace, it
names whatever types the run saw.

Parsed rather than grepped — `import Lava: a, b,` continues across lines, and a
regex either misses the continuation or matches the word in a comment.

Every `Lava.<name>` and every name in an `import Lava: …` list, as `name =>

`Lava` alone — `import Lava`, and the qualifier of a counted `Lava.foo` — is not
a reference to anything. What matters is which of Lava's names Hikari knows.
