# `camera_transform` is a rigid motion, so every target along the view ray
# produces the same matrix and the same image. Nothing in a rendering test can
# therefore catch the distance being wrong -- which is how RayMakie shipped a
# camera whose target sat 1 unit ahead of the eye regardless of the scene.
#
# It is not cosmetic downstream: Makie's `Camera3D` scales pan by
# `2*norm(lookat-eye)/height*delta` and zoom by `lookat - zoom_step*viewdir`,
# while rotation is angular and ignores the distance entirely. On Crown (true
# distance 34.4, geometry ~90x43x100) the 1-unit target left a full pan drag
# moving the camera 0.14 world units and a scroll click 0.10 -- indistinguish-
# able from dead input, while rotation behaved normally.
