# The Vulkan backend module, for the test files that name backend internals.
#
# Hikari's own source does not, and must not — it goes through Mantle's portable
# API. Its TESTS do: `Mantle.LavaBackend`, `Mantle.vk_flush!` and friends, which
# since the 2026-08-27 split live in `MantleVulkanExt` rather than in Mantle. A
# `Main`-level binding serves every file, since they are all `include`d here.
#
# Phase 1.5 deleted this binding and did NOT migrate the nineteen files that
# name it, so the whole GPU half of this suite died on `UndefVarError: MVE` —
# 23 errors that read as "Hikari is broken". It is back, and it is DEBT: the
# names still reached for are `vk_context`, `LavaBackend`, `vk_flush!`,
# `live_buffer_count`, `drain_deferred_frees!`, `device_lost`, `gpu_live_bytes`,
# and each needs either a portable spelling or a deliberate decision that a
# backend-internals test belongs in the backend's own suite.
const MVE = Base.get_extension(Mantle, :MantleVulkanExt)
# NOT `using JET` here. Only `type_stability.jl` and `gpu_compat.jl` need it, and
# it is a test-target dependency, so an environment without it made this line
# throw before the first testset and took all 24 files down with it. The two
# files that use it import it themselves; if JET is missing they fail and the
# rest of the suite still runs, which is the point of the wrapper below.

# One outer testset around every file.
#
# These were bare top-level `include`s, and each file opens its own top-level
# `@testset`. A top-level testset THROWS when it finishes with a failure, so the
# first bad file aborted the run and every later include was silently skipped —
# nothing in the output says "17 files did not run", it just looks like one
# failing testset. That is how `denoise.jl` calling an unbound `KA` (from
# 6ea9555, 2026-08-19) hid files 15 through 23 of this suite until 2026-08-24.
#
# Nested, they report instead of throwing, so one failure costs one file.
