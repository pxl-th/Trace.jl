# `mod24` — the 32-bit replacement for a 64-bit remainder in the ZSobol sampler.
#
# `zsobol_get_sample_index` picks one of pbrt-v4's 24 base-4 digit permutations
# with `(hash >> 24) % 24`, once per base-4 digit, ~16 digits per sample, for
# every sample of every pixel. Written as `% UInt64(24)` that is a 64-bit
# integer division: Apple GPUs have no 64-bit divider and SPIR-V drivers emulate
# one, and it dominated the whole sampler. Measured on an M5 over 350k threads,
# a 16-iteration loop of `mix_bits` alone took 0.69 ms and the same loop with
# one `% UInt64(24)` took 4.09 ms.
#
# The replacement is exact, not approximate, and the sample stream depends on it
# bit for bit — a single wrong permutation index silently changes the sequence
# and every render with it. So this pins the identity against the plain
# remainder rather than against recorded values.
