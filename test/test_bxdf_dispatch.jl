# ============================================================================
# Every material shades through `get_bxdf`, and only through `get_bxdf`
# ============================================================================
#
# Surface shading has exactly one implementation: `vp_shade_material_kernel!{T}`
# (and the closest-hit shader, which calls the same two inner functions). It
# resolves the BxDF once per hit with `get_bxdf` — pbrt-v4's
# `Material::GetBxDF` — and then calls the BSDF methods on the carrier that
# comes back.
#
# There used to be a second implementation reached through `with_index`, live
# for exactly one configuration (hardware RT on a scene with media). It called
# `sample_bsdf_spectral` on the RAW material. Once a material moved to the
# GetBxDF pattern its BSDF methods lived on the carrier, so the raw material
# matched nothing but a gray-Lambertian `::Material` catch-all — silently,
# because a catch-all is a method, not an error. A specular
# `Material "dielectric" "float eta" 1.0` medium boundary therefore became a
# diffuse wall: light could not leave the box and `medium_smoke_point` rendered
# at 0.037 of its reference energy on hardware RT while software RT was fine.
#
# The second implementation is gone. These tests pin what replaced the safety
# it never provided: every material class resolves through `get_bxdf`, and no
# converted material has a BSDF method on its raw type for a future `with_index`
# to find.
