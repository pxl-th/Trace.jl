# A scene whose ONLY object is a medium boundary.
#
# `MediumInterface(NullMaterial(); inside = m)` is pbrt's `Material "interface"`:
# a surface that swaps the ray's medium and does nothing else. A `NullMaterial`
# is never pushed into `scene.materials`, so a scene containing nothing but a
# volume has an EMPTY material set — which is exactly what RayMakie builds for
# `volume!` as the only plot in a scene.
#
# Three call sites asked `with_index(…, materials, idx, …)` about that invalid
# index on the way to the null-material branch that handles it:
# `get_surface_alpha_dispatch`, `is_mix_material_dispatch` and
# `get_perturbed_shading_frame`. `with_index` on an EMPTY `StaticMultiTypeSet`
# expands to `error("with_index: empty StaticMultiTypeSet")`, which a GPU kernel
# cannot raise — so every ray that reached the cube vanished, producing neither a
# continuation ray nor an escape, and the volume rendered as a solid black box at
# exactly zero radiance.
#
# With ANY other material in the scene the same invalid index instead fell into
# `with_index`'s else-branch and read an ARBITRARY material's alpha and
# displacement. That happened to be harmless for an opaque un-bumped material,
# which is why adding an unrelated, off-screen sphere "fixed" the render — and
# why the identity assertion below is the one that matters: an unused material
# type must change nothing.
